Lithium-Ion Battery State of Charge Challenge  

Data from LiFePO4 Battery:
- capacity: 280Ah
- charge upper limit voltage: 3.65V
-  discharge lower threshold voltage: 2.5V
-  rated voltage: 3.2V
-  current rate range: 0~1C
-  rated current rate: 0.2C

data format: steps of 1 second

Criteria:
1. Accuracy: Maximum Absolute Error (MaxAE) measures the largest deviation between estimated and actual SoC values, assessing worst-case scenarios.
2. Robustness: Evaluates the algorithm's stability and accuracy across different conditions.
3. Efficiency: Assesses execution time, memory usage, and consistency across a uniform testing environment.
4. Transient Convergence: Measures the algorithmâ€™s ability to quickly correct incorrect initial SoC values.
5. Documentation: Evaluates clarity, organization, and code quality.

Need good/high/best efficiency (good for embedded use) -> **avoid** neural networks, use system that can easily be made into an FPGA or ASIC, integratable into a BMS  
We'll use an empirical model (along with an electrical model ?) -> provided by the challenge  
1. (off-line) _OCV_-SOC relationship is predetermined  -> stored in lookup table or fitted by a math func
2. (off-line) Get model parameters
3. (on-line) Filtering to better estimation

- Ampere hours integral (AHI) -> needs open circuit voltage (_OCV_)  
- Kalman filter (regular, (adaptive?) extended, (adaptive?) unscented, sigma-point, cubature ?) + regulator/observer (P, PI, PD or PID ?) for error correction/adjustment -> exteded KF because non-linear

Assume that the open circuit voltage is error-free.
